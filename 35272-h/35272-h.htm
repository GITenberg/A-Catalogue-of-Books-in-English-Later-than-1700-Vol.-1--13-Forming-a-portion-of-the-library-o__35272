<p>Led by the belief that the spelling and punctuation of each
entry is based directly on the original title pages no
intentional 'corrections' have been made to the content. The
text in this e-book is as close to the original printed text
as pgdp proofing and postprocessing could get it. In some
entries larger spaces are used as spacers between
bibliographic fields instead of punctuation. These have been
retained to the best of our ability and are represented as
non-breaking spaces.</p></div>

<p>The complete file of the "Spectator" as originally issued in numbers,
seven volumes, Nos. I-DLV from Thursday, March 1, 1711, through
Saturday, December 6, 1712, every day except Sunday. It was resumed on
Friday, June 18, 1714 and published Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays
through No. 635 (misprinted 636) Monday, December 20, 1714. The
numbering of Vol. VIII. is incorrect: 578 is misprinted 579; 584-586,
590-592, 596-598 misprinted 585-587, 591-593, 597-599; 602-604
misprinted 603-605, there is no 607, and 620 is misprinted 610.</p>

<p>Volume VIII. has the imprint: "London: Printed by S. Buckley in Amen
Corner, and J. Tonson in the Strand; where Advertisements will be taken
in." The first two numbers (556 and 557) contain the announcement: "To
be continued every Monday, Wedne&#383;day, and Friday."</p>

<p>Each number consists of one folio leaf, similar to Number I described
above, with a classical quotation varying each day. The words "To be
Continued every Day" were not printed after the first number, and in No.
XVI the imprint on the verso was increased by the addition: "where
Adverti&#383;ements are taken in; as also by Charles Lillie, Perfumer, at
the Corner of Beauford-Buildings in the Strand." Nos. XVII and CCCCLXXIV
do not contain the addition, and it is discontinued from CCCCXCIX to the
end of Volume VII.</p>

<p>"Price Two-pence" first appears at the bottom of No. CCCCXLIV.</p>

<p>Inserted are two legal papers containing contracts and agreements
between the publisher and Addison and Steele.</p>

<p>There was a ninth volume, from Monday, Jan. 3, 1715, through August 5, a
spurious continuation by William Bond.</p>

<p>The present copy was formerly in the libraries of Lord Hope and the Earl
of Munster.</p>

<p>The type of the title-page is larger and heavier than in the preceding

parallel head-lines beginning on page 2 are here heavier. On page 5,
line 47, "wizard" is spelled with one "z"; in the first edition with
two. "Dispatch" in the same line is spelled with an "i"; in the first

attained so great a popularity that it was frequently printed. Cowper
wrote to his friend Unwin, November 4, 1782:&mdash;"You are perfectly at
liberty to deal with them [Gilpin and his feats] as you please. <i>Auctore
tant&ugrave;m anonymo, imprimantur</i>; and when printed, send me a copy."</p>

<p>According to Southey, "The ballad, which had then become the town talk,
was reprinted from the newspaper, wherein it had lain three years
dormant."</p>

<p>The present edition is in chap-book form, and was presumably published
("Price Two-Pence") in consequence of the popularity of the ballad due
to Henderson's recitation of it. There is no means of determining which
is the first edition. Probably several editions were published in the
present form for distribution when the poem was recited.</p>

<p>First edition of the "Task," and the first appearance of "John Gilpin"
among Cowper's Works.</p>

<p>In a letter subsequent to April 22, 1785, Cowper wrote to Mr. Newton:
"When I sent the copy of the <i>Task</i> to Johnson [his publisher], I
desired, indeed, Mr. Unwin to ask him the question, whether or not he
would choose to make it a part of the volume? This I did merely with a
view to promote the sale of it. Johnson answered, 'By all means.' Some
months afterward, he enclosed a note to me in one of my packets, in
which he expressed a change of mind, alleging, that to print John Gilpin
would only be to print what had been hackneyed in every magazine, in
every shop, and at the corner of every street. I answered, that I
desired to be entirely governed by his opinion; and that if he chose to
waive it, I should be better pleased with the omission. Nothing more
passed between us upon the subject, and I concluded that I should never
have the immortal honour of being generally known as the author of John
Gilpin. In the last packet, however, down came John, very fairly
printed, and equipped for public appearance. The business having taken
this turn, I concluded that Johnson had adopted my original thought,
that it might prove advantageous to the sale; and as he had had the
trouble and expense of printing it, I corrected the copy, and let it
pass."&mdash;Southey's Life of Cowper, Volume II, pages 86-87.</p>

<p>Southey continues (page 96): "If Johnson had persisted in his first
intention of excluding that ballad [John Gilpin] from the volume,
because it had already been printed in so many forms and dispersed
everywhere through town and country, he would have committed a greater
mistake than when he suppressed Mr. Newton's preface. Upon second
thoughts he not only admitted it, but specified it in the title-page and
in the advertisement.".&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"The first volume [Poems, 1782] had sold so slowly that it was not
thought prudent to publish the Task and its appendants as a second; but
the first, with a complete list of its contents, was advertised at the
end of the book; and of the many who were induced to read the Task
because it was written by the author of John Gilpin, not a few were led
to inquire for the previous volume because it was by the author of the
Task. In the second edition which was called for in the ensuing year,
the two volumes were connected as first and second, and in the numerous
editions that have succeeded each other they have never been
disunited."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

being an epitaph on Samuel Johnson, LL.D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Oxford, Clarendon Press]
Printed in June, 1896. <i>4to, half red morocco.</i></p>

<p>Half-title and three pages of text, at the beginning of which is the
following note:</p>

<p>"[After the Fourth Edition of Doctor Goldsmith's Retaliation was
printed, the Publi&#383;her received a &#383;upplementary Epitaph on the Wit
and Pun&#383;ter Caleb Whitefoord. Though it is found appended to the later
i&#383;&#383;ues of the Poem, it has been &#383;u&#383;pected that Whitefoord wrote it
him&#383;elf. It may be that the following, which has recently come to
light, is another of his forgeries.]"</p>

<p>Mr. Dobson writes in a letter: "I wrote the 'Postscript' in 1896, to be
read at the Johnson dinner at Pembroke College, Oxford. Johnson had not
been treated in Goldsmith's <i>Retaliation</i>, and I thought I might add a
'Postscript' like the one which is now appended to that poem, on Caleb
Whitefoord, which many think Whitefoord wrote himself. I printed it in
4to to read, and the Clarendon Press reprinted it in 4to to sell. In
1897 it was reproduced in an annual called <i>The Pageant</i>. Then it took
its place in my <i>Poems</i>."</p>

<p>Second issue of the first octavo edition, with the misprint "head," page

<p>The poem was issued in two sizes in 1770, octavo and quarto,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span> but it
cannot be absolutely determined which was the first edition. The former
is without question by far the rarer, and as there is an issue of this
edition containing the misprint "head," which is not found in the
quarto, it is fair to suppose that the octavo is the earlier.</p>

<p>Another 8vo edition of 1770, entirely reset, with larger type and
different ornaments. The type on the title-page is much narrower faced,
the period after "poem" is raised above the line, and there is no period
after "Dr." The dedication is preceded by a band of small printer's
ornaments, terminating at each side in a fleur-de-lis. In the other
edition, two parallel lines, the upper one the heavier, precede the
dedication. As in the other edition, the misprint "head," page 9, line
1, is corrected to "hand."</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
